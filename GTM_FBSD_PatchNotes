FreeBSD notes for GT.M
======================
(some parts are similar or same as on OpenIndiana)

Prereqs:
--------
- FreeBSD 9.0/amd64
- cmake 2.8.5 or newer, ncurses, libexecinfo, libicu (optional?),
  libelf (be careful about which libelf you're going to use!!)
- gcc 4.x, gmake


Known potentially hazardous hacks:
----------------------------------
Patch notes 8, 11, 9, 17, where the first is most critical
and the last is least important.


Patch notes:
------------
(1) I don't know how it happened that the same SET(CMAKE_*
blocks appears two times in CMakeLists.txt.
For sure, this is needed for both OpenIndiana and FreeBSD,
because we need:
- enforce x86_64/amd64 defs
- have the right CMAKE*SIZEOF* values

...for example, on OpenIndiana, cmake doesn't set these CMAKE_*
variables with respect on hardware configuration automatically :(

(2) FreeBSD and OpenIndiana has nonstandard include/library paths,
so we need to get some -I/-L args passed to a compiler.

Since my goal was to get it working, I was not so hesitating about
puting all these extra arguments into add_definitions() function.

(3) Since we started out with Linux version, we expected that FreeBSD
build should behave as Linux with only few exceptions.
This is the reason why we use -D__linux__ in conjunction with
-D__freebsd__ even if we don't build for Linux.

To avoid some indications that we may be on ix86 box (for example,
on OpenIndiana, where part of the userspace is 32bit and we have
to force even the compiler to explicitly run in 64b mode), we used
-U__i386, just to be sure.
For similar reasons, we added -D__amd64__ and -D__x86_64__.

(4) On FreeBSD, we need libexecinfo to cover internal backtracing
facilities.

(5) Linked complained that we didn't supplied environ and __progname
symbols within version script of gtmexe.export and probably others.
So we've added it and it works :)

(6) ^GDEINIT routine was missing FreeBSD definitions, so it's also
added, with similar params like Linux and others.

(7) although we have (in the time I was not sure if we'll be
able to get a complete build) configured face M_MMAP_MAX macro,
it should not be merged anywhere because in the final effect,
it is not used anywhere (because the function that used it
will not be called in the case of FreeBSD).
This affected sr_port/gtm_malloc.h and sr_port/gtm_malloc_src.h files.

(8) in the time when we were not sure if we will be able to reach
100% of build procedure, we did a big hack in
  sr_unix/extract_signal_info.c
by adding fake #define EIP which is not used in final effect too
because the line of code that uses it is commented.
This is a big XXX, because I was not able to find how to do the
same task in FreeBSD (there us uc_mcontext, but looks differently).

(9) sr_unix/gtmio.h has added OPENFILE_SYNC support for __freebsd__,
but we should make a revision it can be used like this or changed.
I am not aware of O_DASYNC (and friends) equivalent on FBSD.

(10) FreeBSD has it's own "union semun" structure in /usr/include
headers, and it is defined exactly in the same way, so we wrapped
it by #ifndef __freebsd__.

(11) sr_unix/gt_timers.c -- I have hacked there '#define HZ 100'
but I have absolutely no idea where to get this value on FreeBSD
and if HZ=100 is the right value! :(

(12) FreeBSD does not know SIGCLD signal, so we defined it as SIGCHLD.

(13) FreeBSD does not know setpgrp of zero arity, so we changed all
the setpgrp() calls to setpgrp(0,0).

(14) FreeBSD has sigsetjmp instead of __sigsetjmp. But I have read
somewhere that they think about renaming it to __sigsetjmp in future.

(15) sr_x86_64/obj_filesp.c -- for FreeBSD, we want ELF OS ABI to be
FreeBSD instead of Linux.

(16) FreeBSD should have KEY_T_LONG according to <sys/_types.h>.
That fact was reflected to sr_unix/mdefsp.h.

(17) FreeBSD's IPC implementation has permission flags incompatible
with most of the rest of UNIX systems and that's why we need
to change sr_unix/iosp.h file to get semaphores working well
without Permission denied (errno=13) errors for concurrent DB access.

WARNING: we changed RALL/RWALL/RWDALL definitions which may be
(correctly and without penalties) used for another syscalls like
open() on many UNIX systems.
These arguments are currently used only for semget() calls, but
it would be better to prefix them so they will start with SEM_
what will prevent people to use them outside the world of semaphores.
